# Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that covers Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleaning, conversion of columns to float datatype, and the development of a Linear Regression model. The dataset used in this analysis was collected from Sai Vidya Institute of Technology's AIML (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) branch. The dataset includes information on height, shoe size, 10th percentage, and PUC (Pre-University Course) percentage of students.

## Dataset Description

- **Height**: The height of the students.
- **Shoe Size**: The shoe size of the students.
- **10th Percentage**: The percentage obtained in the 10th-grade examination.
- **PUC Percentage**: The percentage obtained in the Pre-University Course examination.

## Analysis Overview

The Jupyter Notebook is structured as follows:

1. **Loading and Understanding the Dataset**: Loading the dataset into the notebook, understanding its structure, and data cleaning.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, converting columns to float datatype, and scaling.
 
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the data to gain insights, visualize distributions, and identify patterns. Includes plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

4. **Linear Regression Model**: Implementing and training a linear regression model to predict PUC percentage based on 10th percentage. Calculating R2 score.
